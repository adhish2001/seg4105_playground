# Problem
User should have an option to view past history in a way that is intuitive and also insightful. In order to be more useful and to provide incentive into using the app, an option to record and view past data is important to users. Without storing past data there is a hole in functionality and an incetive towards using our app to make workouts and routines. Currently there is no way for the user to access previous history or view previous history with ease. This feature should Ideally be implemented in the home page. This is open to design but the goal is to have a way that encourages the user to view past history.

# Appetite
This does require a multitide of skills, design to create the widget and the flow of the widget, front-end implementation, and the back-end storing of data and api calls that will be used. Although it requires multiple skills because it require a low amount of effort an all sides this can be completed in a small batch having a few developers in our team to work in a 2 week cycle this feature should be complete. Something to note is that in order for this to be complete it requires sessions to be complete and workout history to be complete.

# Solution
Creating a calendar widget is the ideal solution that is intuive and easy for the user to understand and use. The user selects a data within the week or an icon on the calendar widget to take them to general session history. This widget can also be built to display the week's workout within the calendar.

1. Display of weekly workouts
2. Navigate to past session history
3. Display list of previous workouts and stats like calories

## Rabbit Holes

CSV conversion, displaying data that can be stored and exported into a csv format so the user can also store it locally. Hard to estimate the complexity or the work required on back-end. Althought this is possible and I have verified that there is CSV conversion provided from MongoDB and this does provide value because of other pending tasks like making sure our site is usable and intuitive. 

## No Go's
Pulling Data across apps or from Apple Health kit, since we are a web application this wouldn't be possible.
