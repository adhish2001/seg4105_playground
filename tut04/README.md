# Summary of Shape up 7-9: Part 2 Betting

## Chapter 7: Bets, Not Backlogs

Unlike a traditional backlog, letting people indivually track their own pitches or bets leads to more productivity.
A back-log takes up time to groom and to organize that could be better spend into creating new pitches and bets. The labour into a backlog doesn't translate well into productivity either.
Keep a few potential bets, let peopple indivually track what they think is inmportant and in the next 6 week cycle bring it up again to pitch or bet. This accomplishes two big functions:

1. A decentralized list-no labour to organize
2. Important ideas are not lost, they are brought over again and lobbied again

## Chapter 8: The Betting Table

6 weeks cycle is ideal because a typical 2 week sprint is too short to get anything meaningful done and it's a heavy overhead to plan. Of course there are smaller tasks and spikes that need to be investigated towards, which is why after a 6-week cycle a two week cool-down period is made. This cool-down lets developer complete smaller tasks that they couldn't complete during the cycle. Within a cycle there is fixed size team that can either work on a "big-batch" - 1 project or "small batch" - multiple small projects.
To decide what to do in a cycle there is a betting table that includes the stakeholders,since we pitch directly to stakeholders we can avoid a waiting period where we have to wait for approval from upper-managment.
The goal is to have uninterrupted time during the cycle to complte the pitch.
Bugs are down in cool-down and the slate should be clean.

## Chapter 9: Place Your Bets

When betting the main steps are

1. Analyze current state: what are our existing products,new products and what is in R&D
2. Production Mode: look at what is in R&D and begin shaping for production. We can bet multiple teams in parallel and the goal is shipping not spiking, we want features to be psuhed into production.
3. Clean-up mode: Right before shipping there is a clean up perid where "bugs are bashed" and there is no team allocation but everyone helps and cleans wherever the can. Trying to get stable before we can ship and keeping the product clean and stable.
