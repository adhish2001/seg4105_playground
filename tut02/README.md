Shape Up Summary Chapter 2-5
Chapter 2: Principles of Shaping
Wireframes are too concrete and words are too abstract. The principles of shaping the goal should be that the requirements are specific and clear for the designer and team so they can understand but the route to the goal of the product is vague enough that it’s open to their own interpretation on how to get there. 

The problem with wireframes is that they are too concrete. When the design and everything is forced upon the team it becomes hard to estimate time and there are hidden complexities that can create problems.

The fundamental properties are
It’s rough
It’s solved
It’s bounded

There are 4 main steps
Set boundaries
Rough out the elements
Address risks and rabbit holes
Write the pitch

Two tracks involved shaping and building 1 team shapes while other builds.

Chapter 3: Set Boundaries
Always begins with a raw idea. The next step is to set the appetite. This is because the team may get too excited with an idea or feature even though it may be too much for a 6 week cycle. It could also be the opposite where it’s too small.

A good way to differentiate is:
Small batch: 1 designer and 2 programmers can build the project in two weeks. We can do multiple small batches into 1 big batch(6-week cycle)

Big Batch: This project takes the same-size team a full 6 weeks

Appetite and estimate are different. Appetite starts with a number and ends with a design.
Good is relative, oftentimes the best option can take too long and be a “meal” too large.
When responding to raw ideas avoid maybes or soft nos instead wait till the idea is shaped.
Narrow done the problem: unpack the issue and deep dive what are the requirements and what is the cause of the problem.

Raw Idea, an appetite, and an narrow problem definition


Chapter 4: Find the Elements
Move at the right speed: either alone or with a partner that won’t slow things down.
The questions trying to be answered are:
Where in the current system does the new thing fit?
How do you get to it?
What are the key components or interactions?
Where does it take you?

Breadboarding: specify the components and interactions without worrying about the visual design. To breadboard 3 questions to focus on are:
Places: These are the things that you can navigate to like dialogues, screens, or menus and pop-ups
Affordances: Things the user can act on, like buttons or fields.Interface copy is also an affordance. Reading is an act that gives the user information for subsequent interactions.
Connection Lines: These show how the affordances take the user from place to place.

Sometimes breadboarding is not an option because it’s a design you are working on. In this case fat-marker sketches are an option to use.

Elements are the output, leave room for designers and make sure it’s not a deliverable or conveyor belt leave actionable steps.

Chapter 5: Risks and Rabbit Holes
It is important to scrutinize potential pitfalls or rabbit holes because in a fixed time scope these pitfalls and rabbit holes can cause significant delays in time and cost. The worst case scenario is when you encounter a problem that causes the project to be abandoned.

Rabbit holes are technical unknowns which there isn’t information to accurately scope the issue.

The best thing to do is simplify hard problems to the best of your ability to prevent the least amount of unknowns. If a feature is “out of bounds” you should move it to a different cycle.

The final and most important thing you can do is introduce technical experts to directly tackle and identify and scrutinize the possible pitfalls and “rabbit holes”
