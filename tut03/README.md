Notes taken while listening

Shape-up part of 37 signals philosophy around product development.
Pitch is a direction. A direction that typically begins with "here is a problem our customer have" and then there is an 800 word pitch providing a soln to solve it.
Mostly words possible sketch or two.
Framing=Define problem and the business value in solving the problem. Don't specify the soln.
Pitch Defines the soln.Pitches can be thrown around but a formalized pitch is the next step.
Customers are exceleent at finding where it hurts but they don't know how to solve it.
In an attempt to solve customer's problems we can get congestion, that's why find patterns to the problem.
In a pitch find 5 references(10,20) to find a problem, and then an expert to find a possible solution.
This way the pitch can find a solution for 4-6 weeks.
Usually a team of 2, designer and programmer. Their is an explanation but the actual solution design is done by this team.
The pitch shouldn't have a lot of constraints that allows the team room to negotiate and to succesfully build and design the solution.
Find people who can embrace the technology, this is to avoid "code monkeys" making your own solution allows for creativity and understanding.
Defering to the material is best. A pitch at best can do is give really good direction in the first 2 weeks.
3 things drawn upon for employee satisfaction: autonmy, mastery, and purpose.
Pitches allows for all of those. This leads to self-actualization, gets 6 cycles a year and gratifying people.
Last 2 steps in shape-up is rabbit holes and pits.
A rabbit-hole is where there is a lot of work happening but not much progress is being made. Very incremental value for a lot of work.
The earlier the rabbit-hole is spot the more likely the team can focus on the product or features that provide the most value to the end-user.
Science-project: another term similar to rabbit hole. When the whole pitch is a rabbit-hole, the amount of work takes too much time and resources.
Traceable bullet, a micro pitch. Spike can also be used. This is when the team dedicates 2-4 days to look into the problem and then decide the length of the pitch.

Summary:
To summarize this podcast mutlitple things were gone over but the key takeaways are:

Frame before the pitch: defining the problem and the business value of solving that problem.

To make a good pitch typically you want to obtain several reference to prove that it's a problem, of course customers may not know the solution so leave the solution open-ended.

To devise a good pitch obtain an expert to get isnights on how to resolve the problem and to find an idea of how long this will take 4 weeks or 6 weeks.

Typically an ideal size is 2 people a designer and a programmer who work on creating the pitch. This allows enough of an explanation but the actual solution can be created by the team

There should be flexibility when pitching, allow the team fro creative input.

To keep good team morale pitching is great because it allows for: autonomy, mastery and purpose.

The employee gets to design the own solution and obtains mastery through completion and is gratified by the result of their product.

Another thing to consider is rabbit holes and pitches, these are essentially traps. Where a lot of work can be dedicated while the progress is minimal.

Science-project is another title given toa pitch where the entire scope is a rabbit hole.

To prevent rabbit-holes: we use "traceable-bullets" or spikes can be made. This is when an investment of 2-4 days is made to delve or investigate a problem so a pitch with less unknowns can be made.
