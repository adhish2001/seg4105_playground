# TUT06: Betting Table

## Individual Work Session: Wednesday Oct 11

Here is my review and summary of all the other pitches in my group.
Luka David's Pitch: https://github.com/LukaDavid04/seg4105_playground/tree/main/del01

Social Interaction is the feature presented. This feature is meant to make users motivated through fostering a community. The feature includes the back-end and complete functionality of this so front-end as well.
By simplifying the process of finding and connecting with others, it addresses the common challenge of staying motivated and accountable for regular physical activity.
Some the details that need to taken into consideration is data privacy as a no go and visibility of information displayed.
This is because of ethical reasons as well as the client satisfaction they should have the option to change visbility and the ability to have privacy using our app.
This feature takes 4 weeks approx to complete.

Khai Tran's Pitch: https://github.com/khaiqtran13/seg4105_playground/tree/main/lab03
The problem is a lack of real-time engagement for users during workouts, making it difficult to monitor progress and exercise details, which can decrease motivation and consistency.
The proposed solution is an "Active Session Interface" with features like real-time tracking, pause/resume, workout summary, and session history.
This will be big batch 6 weeks to complete.
Real-time sharing and advanced analytics are excluded from the project, while efficient data storage and retrieval for active sessions are crucial to prevent data loss due to accidental refreshes or exits.
Personally this isn't as important as the social aspect.

Andy Ung's Pitch: https://github.com/andyung17/seg4105_playground/tree/main/lab03
The feature aims to simplify the process of creating personalized workout routines by using a closed-question survey to accommodate user preferences and restrictions.
The problem it addresses is the overwhelming number of exercise choices, causing decision paralysis for individuals trying to become more active.
The feature's appetite is a 6-week timeline to design a user-friendly survey that gathers essential information without collecting personal data. Users can save the generated workout routine and have the option to undo or restart the survey. The focus is on avoiding biases and ensuring quick and accurate results, with no consideration of previous workouts or personal questions in the decision-making process. The primary goal is to create tailored workout playlists for users of any proficiency level.

Avaneesh Madaram's Pitch: https://github.com/AvaneeshM/seg4105_playground/tree/main/lab03
The problem addressed is the difficulty people face in finding or creating personalized workouts.
To solve this, a login and signup feature will be introduced in FitShare, allowing users to create and store their workouts, share them with others, and connect with more experienced gym members.
The feature aims to be completed within a 6-week timeframe, with a simple login and signup process, requiring minimal user input.
The user interface will include fields for input and authentication, but not overly complicate the process by requesting unnecessary personal details.
Two-factor authentication (2FA) is not a priority for the login feature at this stage and should be considered a no-go.

This feature doesn't directly address the problem. Login and register doesn't solve the issue in obtaining a personalized workout.

## The Bet Thursday Oct 12

The pitch that was voted on unanimously was Andy's as it was the feature that we considered to provide the most value proposition.The other pitches had value to and can be completed in parallel but we wanted to thing about the problem and solution that Andy provided and it made the most sense within our timeframe.

## Kick-Off Thursday Oct 12

The current task allocation is to have Andy work on Dev-ops and quality assurance related to this feaure.
Me and Avaneesh will work on front-end components and design of the survey and components that will contain this feature.
Khai and Luka will work on the back-end scheme and database work related to this feature.
Changes requsted are shown on Andy's Pitch commit history: https://github.com/andyung17/seg4105_playground/tree/main/lab03

## Meeting Notes

This is to thank everyone for creating and participating in yesterdays Pitch and Betting process. They provided useful insight in determining next steps and things to consider for the FitShare application.

With that being said, there could only be one winner to fit into the next 6-week development cycle. The criteria below was determining factor as to which pitch was chosen from the betting process:
Is it a valid problem that needs to be solved?
Does it require a full 6-weeks of allocated time to complete?
Can the entire team work together to complete the feautre?
Does it align with the core aspects of the application?

For the new upcoming cycle, it is anticipated that we will be spending 6-weeks of development on this new aspect of our product. The winner from all the pitches was...

Workout Generation by Andy Ung
Going forward for this 6-week cycle, we will be tackling implementing a workout generation feature to support the FitShare application. This is to support our users of creating workouts and routines that can be shared. The pre-existing framework will remain intact, but new additions to both front and back-end will need to be incorporated.

For this new cycle, similar roles will remain from before.

@Avaneesh @Adhish will create prototypes to simulate the user interfaces and interactions that would support this feature. (Workout generator pages, interactions from the rest of the application, etc)
@Khai @Luka will be working on developing the algorithm that is creating the workout generator and any addition supporting mechanisms that the rest of the application will need (endpoints, etc)
@Andy (I) will be leading this cycle and be mainly overseeing development for this feature. I intend to participate in the testing component of this cycle.

Once again, thank you team for the hardwork and looking forward to this new cycle
