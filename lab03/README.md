# Feature

The feature that I will be 'shaping' is the Calendar feature on our workout App. This will be a widget that will eiter be part of the Profile component card or it's own seperate card that will be displayed on the homepage or the stats page.

The use-case depends on the front-end flow. In our to help us understand the use case we can use a "bread-board"

## Shaping Work

#Problem
User should have an option to view past history in a way that is intuitive and also insightful. In order to be more useful and to provide incentive into using the app, an option to record and view past data is important to users. Without storing past data there is a hole in functionality and an incetive towards using our app to make workouts and routines.

# Appetite

This does require a multitide of skills, design to create the widget and the flow of the widget, front-end implementation, and the back-end storing of data and api calls that will be used. Although it requires multiple skills because it require a low amount of effort an all sides it should take a 4-week cycle to complete.

#Solution
Creating a calendar widget is the ideal solution that is intuive and easy for the user to understand and use. The user selects a data within the week or an icon on the calendar widget to take them to general session history. This widget can also be built to display the week's workout within the calendar.

1. Display of weekly workouts
2. Navigate to past session history
3. Display list of previous workouts and stats like calories

## Rabbit Holes

CSV conversion, displaying data that can be stored and exported into a csv format so the user can also store it locally. Hard to estimate the complexity or the work required on back-end.

## No Go's

1. Pulling Data across apps or from Apple Health kit, since we are a web application.
