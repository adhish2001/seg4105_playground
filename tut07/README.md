# Summary of SCRUM Guide focusing on the "daily-stand-up"

SCRUM is a 15 minute time boxed event that would occur in each working day. This means meetings are short and concise and they provide value to all attendees. It's an oppurtuinity to show progress and what's currently being done and any blockers. This greatly helps in fostering collaboration between developers as there is minum time wastage but still high value.

The key is value. SCRUM is not an excuse to talk about problems but to communicate progress done and what you are currently working on.

The continous efforts of SCRUM also trickle down to helping and focusing on the SPRINT goal.

When doing SCRUM the questions to focus on are:

1. What did I do yesterday to contribute to the Sprint Goal?
2. What will I do today to support the Sprint Goal?
3. Are there any impediments hindering me or the team from achieving the Sprint Goal?
