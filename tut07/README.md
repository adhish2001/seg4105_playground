# Summary of SCRUM Guide focusing on the "daily-stand-up"

SCRUM is a 15 minute time boxed event that would occur in each working day. This means meetings are short and concise and they provide value to all attendees. It's an oppurtuinity to show progress and what's currently being done and any blockers. This greatly helps in fostering collaboration between developers as there is minum time wastage but still high value.

The key is value. SCRUM is not an excuse to talk about problems but to communicate progress done and what you are currently working on.

The continous efforts of SCRUM also trickle down to helping and focusing on the SPRINT goal. Individuals who are blocked can communicate where the blockage is occuring and because everyone is sharing details of their progress so when it comes to next planning poker people have a good understanding on which tasks take long.

When doing SCRUM the questions to focus on are:

1. What did I do yesterday to contribute to the Sprint Goal?
2. What will I do today to support the Sprint Goal?
3. Are there any impediments hindering me or the team from achieving the Sprint Goal?

The Daily Scrum has several benefits, including improved communication, the elimination of other meetings, identification and removal of impediments, facilitation of quick decision-making, and increased knowledge within the Development Team. It is a crucial inspect and adapt meeting in the Scrum framework.

# Summary of "SHOW progress" chapter 13

## The tasks that aren't there

When making a list we can have situation where there are a lot of tasks done but some sporadically missing across multiple sub-lists. It's easy to look at this and say this is a lot of progress. But we we have to take into aaccount context, maybe the devloeprs are unaware that this task exist which is why it's being procastinated on or maybe these tasks are more difficult. You shouldn't fall on just looking at progress from lists is the goal but instead the context and progress across the project.

## Estimates Don't Show Uncertainty

Estimates don't show the entire picture. Maybe for a task we estimate 4 hours but we have history on that task and we know that estimate is accurate another task that is 4 hours but has multiple unknowns can take longer so we shouldn't focus too much on using estimates unless we have history of said task.

## Work Is Like a Hill

This is approach essentially means when coming to complete tasks there is unknown and to do section. Before we can even start the task we have to understand the unknowns, ie. making a dinner party would require us to make a menu and find who to invite before we can actually begin cooking or acquiring the food and sending invites.

## Scopes On the Hill

We can create sub-tasks/or scope the task and when making the hill we can create speerate colors so we can easily track the progress across multiple points.

## Status Without Asking

As a manger you don't want to be asing for status updates, instead status should be shown without asking. By using hill charts in basecamp in conjunction with to-do lists we can make sure that members and the manager are able to track the entire progress of the project without deliberatley asking members.

## Nobody Says I don't Know

Nobody wants to mention that they have a problem but by looking at the Hillchat we can see if someon hasn't moved their icon that they need resources in order to get past the hill.

## Prompts to Refactor Scopes

Sometimes there is progress even if the progress isn't shown on the hill chart this requires scope refactoring. By breaking down chunkier scopes into smaller sub scopes it is easier to see progress being displayed.

## Build Your Way Uphill

Teams should take thier time when moving scopes along the hill. The end of the hill should be "I've done enough work I don't know if there are any other unknowns". This prevents down-sliding or readjusting. It is very easy for users to fall in the trap of think something is easy and moving the scope before actually completing it and moving the scope.

## Solve in the Right Sequence

Solve in the irght sequence takes into account the philsophy of works fills up to take the amount of time given. By wokring in the right sequence.
