Paragraph from findings in research:

Product managers and project managers are two separate roles, there are some redundancies between each role but in the future project managers are more valuable and favored by most teams. In most cases both can co-exist and another role to be considered is product owner.

So far we’ve established that there are 3 titles with similar roles and responsibilities; 1)product manager-communicates with client to create the goals and requirements, 2)Project manager-hands on with the team creates roles tasks and supervises the success of the project, 3) Product owner- similar to project manger but this role owns the product and leads SCRUM of the methodology being used by the team

Of the 3 roles project manager shares the most between the product owner and product manager, there are more roles that make them stand out. Since they have hands-on communication with the team and client technical skills are required as well as communication skills since we’ve known that communicating with the client is difficult since they themselves might not know what they want. Of course since they work closely with the technical team they must also have the technical skills required to lead and provide the team members with the resources and tools that are required. A surprise to find out was that they also need to manage morale, creating schedules that have hard sprints as well as downtime and team lunches are actions a project manager can take to make sure the team has high morale and the project is successful.
