# Feature

The feature that will be "fat markered" is the calendar widget that has been previously mentioned in Lab03. Last time we shaped the calendar this time we will fat marker it and give very basic design ideas. Because this is the same feature it will also contain the same Bread Board.

## Information: Edge Cases, Rabbit Holes

Maybe the user doesn't complete that many workouts in a week so a weekly schedule widget may not be ideal and instead a monthly schdeule design should be implemented instead. Another rabbit hole is the exporting and importing of Data to this widget. This component should be a read-only component and there shouldn't be too many interactions. Adding interactions could make it too congested.

The desing should be intuitve and meet the goals for the most amount of clients.
